      <p>
        We're holding a mixer in Delhi on October 26th, 2024 - the first of its
        kind. The plan is for it to be a casual event with 20 people at the
        maximum, at a venue that's convenient for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea is to hold this as a "pilot" event - bring younger and older
        Exun alumni together, hold some light-hearted competitions (read quizzes) to break the
        ice, create a platform for them to share ideas and experiences, and see
        how we can help each other out in the future. Hopefully, the pilot event turns into a template for future events across cities.
      </p>


      <p>
        The event will have a small registration fee of ₹1000, which will be
        used to cover the costs of the venue, and some food and drinks.
      </p>

      <p>We'll share more details about the venue as and when we have them! You can request to register for the event at the button above, send a payment to the VPA mentioned, and we'll confirm your spot.</p>

      <p>See you there!</p>
