        WhatsApp, please let us know so we can plan accordingly!

        The Delhi Mixer at India International Centre was special! Alumni from
        various batches came together for an evening of nostalgia, networking,
        and great conversations. There was representation across batches (I
        personally met some people after 10+ years), and the event had a small
        quiz, some lunch and a keynote by

            >Urgently need TypeScript devs for my workplace. Company is based in
            Australia with worldwide clients. Pay is per hour - experienced devs
            can start at 25 USD or AUD equivalent, less for junior devs (to be
            discussed with management). Good work-life balance with minimal
            meetings (daily standup and biweekly reviews). Flexible timezone
            arrangements available. You'll work under me as the tech lead.
            Interview process: 30min technical interview + 30min management
            interview. Projects involve full-stack TypeScript work with AWS
            infrastructure (CDK/CloudFormation experience is a plus). Longer job
            description coming soon. Contact: vidur.butalia@lewinnovation.com or
