       <h2>Hi, Exun Alum!</h2>
       <p>
        The previous newsletter drew a very encouraging response, and the community has grown to 188 people as of writing this! Here's some highlights from previous month, and updates on upcoming events.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Upcoming</h3>
      
      <h4>Delhi Mixer</h4>
      <img src="https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,background=white,quality=75,width=400,height=400/event-covers/is/182b53f0-14d5-46d3-9dae-e9f7d1e4f749" width=300 style="display:block; margin: auto;" />
      <p>
        We've finalised the location for the event: the <strong>India International Centre</strong>. You can sign up on
        <a href="https://lu.ma/0fbx1suw" target="_blank"
          >the event page</a
        >. It's a small venue so we have very few slots left - if you're planning to attend, make sure you send in the registration fees to confirm your place at the event.<br/>To those of you who can make it to the Delhi mixer, we're looking
        forward to meeting you! 
      </p>

      <h3>Highlights</h3> 
      
      <h4>Events</h4>
      There were multiple alumni meet-ups across cities last month, so we started a list to keep track of them: <a href="https://www.exunalumni.com/events" target="_blank">https://www.exunalumni.com/events</a>

      </figure>
      
      <h4>Job Posts</h4>
      A few members posted jobs that they â€“ or people they know - are hiring for, so we decided to get â€“ you guessed it â€“ a list going to track those: <a href="https://exunalumni.com/hiring" target="_blank">https://exunalumni.com/hiring</a>
      
      <h4>Community</h4>
      The community saw a lot of new members joining; with multiple memories, old pictures and anecdotes being exchanged on the group.

         We're still working on getting more legal formalities out of the way so that we can take the fundraising process â€“ which so many of you wanted to be a part of â€“ forward. That'll help us move the needle on the actual mission, but incremental progress, I guess. More updates on this hopefully in the coming months.

          PS: An active discussion happened around Exun Alumni merch in the group, and we're soliciting opinions/demand: Would you be interested in Exun Alumni branded merchandise? Something from <a href="https://merchery.co/" target="_blank">https://merchery.co/</a> perhaps? (I'm looking at the Patagonia sweaters ðŸ‘€) Write back with suggestions of items if you are indeed interested, and we might take this up!
