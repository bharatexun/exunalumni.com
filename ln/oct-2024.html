        highlights from previous month, and updates on upcoming events.

            <strong>Network:</strong> Multiple alumni posted about jobs that
            they or companies they are in are hiring for, so we created a list

      There were multiple alumni meet-ups across cities last month, so we
      started a list to keep track of them and store photos:

      <h4>Delhi Mixer</h4>
      <p>
        We've finalised the location for the event: the
        <strong>India International Centre</strong>. There's more details on
        <a href="https://lu.ma/0fbx1suw" target="_blank">the event page</a>.
        It's a small venue so we only have limited slots - if you're planning to
        attend, make sure you send in the registration fees to confirm your
        place at the event. <br /><br />To those of you who can make it to the
        Delhi mixer, we're looking forward to meeting you!
      </p>

      <div class="footer">
        <em>
          PS: We're still working on getting more legal formalities out of the
          way so that we can take the fundraising process â€“ which a lot of you
          volunteered to participate in â€“ forward. That'll help us move the
          needle on the actual mission, but incremental progress, I guess. More
          updates on this hopefully in the coming months.
        </em>
        <br /><br />
        <em>
          PPS: An active discussion happened around Exun Alumni merch in the
          group, and we're soliciting opinions/demand: Would you be interested
          in Exun Alumni branded merchandise? Something from
          <a href="https://merchery.co/" target="_blank"
            >https://merchery.co/</a
          >
          perhaps? (I'm looking at the Patagonia sweaters ðŸ‘€) Write back with
          suggestions of items if you are indeed interested, and we might take
          this up!
