    "description": "Hey guys, currently working @Predii. We are hiring for few roles -  1. NLP Research Engineer  2. Vision Research Engineer. What do we do? Most of us have gone through the experience of  taking our car in service. However, we donâ€™t really think about whatâ€™s going on in backend, everything it takes to be able to diagnose the problem - finding the right parts, performing the correct repair and get it done in a matter of hours so you can get your car back asap. In fact, the dealerships & repair shops have to accomplish this at a time when the number of experienced technicians is declining, interestingly only a third of them are over the age of 55 and the vehicles themselves are becoming more and more complex. This is where we come in - in fancy terms - we are taking the charge, applying AI to such challenges faced in the Automotive service & repair industry.
