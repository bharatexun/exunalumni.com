          PS: How good is
          <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/" target="_blank">Flux</a>, the
          latest open-source image generation model? I made

          for the mixer in one prompt, it cost $0.025 (in free credits) and I
          think it looks pretty darn neat. <br /><br />

          ideas.
