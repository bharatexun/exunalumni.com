      <h2>Hi, Exun alum!</h2>

      <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Highlights from the last two months:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Support:</strong> We received a very, very encouraging
            response from Exun alumni across decades to get this initiative off
            the ground - including financial support, volunteering and just
            spreading the word.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Events:</strong> We're planning the first – of what we hope
            will be many – mixer for older and younger
            Exun alumni on
            <a href="https://exunalumni.com/mx-1" target="_blank">October 26th, 2024</a>.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Support:</strong> We've started a WhatsApp community for
            alumni to connect, and have had a bunch of people join. <br />
            Read the <a href="https://exunalumni.com/intro" target="_blank">introductions</a> people
            have put up.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        It's been an exciting two months since we sent out the letter. The
        response has been overwhelming and we're grateful for everyone's
        support.
      </p>

      <p>
        We've formed the WhatsApp community for alumni to connect, and have had
        a bunch of people join.

        is the invite link if you haven't joined it yet - if you have, please do
        share it with Exun alumni you know. We put up a small page to store the
        introductions people have put up on
        <a href="https://exunalumni.com/intro" target="_blank">https://exunalumni.com/intro</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're working hard behind the scenes to finalise the Delhi mixer details
        - including venue, timings, events and swag. More details and
        registration information for the mixer is available
        <a href="https://exunalumni.com/mx-1" target="_blank"></a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To those of you who can make it to the Delhi mixer, we're looking
        forward to meeting you! To everyone else, please do join the WhatsApp
        community, and we'll hopefully come back soon with details of a mixer in
        your city.
      </p>

          for the mixer in one prompt, it cost $0.025 (in free credits) and I think it looks pretty darn
          neat.
